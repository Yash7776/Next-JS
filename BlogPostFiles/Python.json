    "Content":"Python was conceived in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands; it was conceived as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Python implementation began in December, 1989.[44] Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his permanent vacation from responsibilities as Python's benevolent dictator for life (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[45] (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled BDFL-emeritus.) In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47] The name Python is said to derive from the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus.[48",
